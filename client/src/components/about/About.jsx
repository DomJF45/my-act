          <h2>What is ACT?</h2>
          <div></div>
          <div>
            <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a cognitive behavioral intervention technique centered around improving psychological flexibility.
              The rational behind ACT is based on evidence that mindfullness and acceptance are adaptive responses to events in life that are inevitable. Acceptance can be defined as “letting go of what could have, or should have been, and accepting that an event has happened” and mindfullness can be defined as “A state of attention where one focuses on the present moment and calmly acknowledges feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations”. The combination of both acceptance and mindfullness is imperative to ACT as it acknowledges that the attempt to control painful emotions, or psychological experiences, is counterproductive and only leads to further suppression of the issues at hand. In consequence, this leads to significantly more distress within the individual. In recent years, ACT has become well established in the field of applied psychology for treating disorders including (but not limited to): general anxiety, chronic pain, depression, OCD, and social anxiety. There are a plethora of ACT techniques, while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is best instructed by a licensed therapist, ACT is a technique that many can do from the comfort of their own home. There exists a great deal of ACT worksheets constructed by professionals so that those who will benefit from ACT can do so from the comfort of their own space. </p>

          <div></div>
          <div>
            <p>The general goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility – the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to change or persist in behavior when doing so serves valued ends. Psychological flexibility is established through six core ACT processes. Each of these areas are conceptualized as a positive psychological skill, not merely a method of avoiding psychopathology</p>
