          <h3>All about the Self:</h3>
          <p>Self in ACT is defined as a perspective for one to be aware of one’s own “flow” while the concept of responsibility or attachment is observed contextually and without judgment / emotion. The concept of self is meant to be rigid and through a plethora of emotions, nothing can change the self. It is often used in metaphors as a comparison to the sky; even when there are clouds and storms, the sky will always be there. The self is no different.</p>
